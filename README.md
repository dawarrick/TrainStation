# TrainStation 

## This app will display the trains that are coming into the station based on a first train starting time, and frequency.
### It will calculate when the next train will arrive, and how many minutes until it will arrive.
### Admin users (which is currently everyone) will be allowed to add new trains, update trains, and delete trains.  Input elements will be validated.
### The train information is stored in a Firebase database.
### The train information will be refreshed each minute.
