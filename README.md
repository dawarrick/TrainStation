# TrainStation 

## This app will display the trains that are coming into the station based on the daily schedule.
## It will calculate when the next train will arrive, and how many minutes until it will arrive.
## Admin users (which is everyone for this demo) will be allowed to add new trains, update trains and delete trains.
## The train information is stored in a Firebase database.
